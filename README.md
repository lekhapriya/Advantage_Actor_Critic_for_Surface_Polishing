# Sustainable Approach to Surface Polishing of 3D Printed Components using Reinforcement Learning

This repository is created as part of the course project for CSCE 689, Reinforcement Learning. It includes the python code to implement Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm for surface polishing experiment on Ti-6Al-4V metal sample.

## Description
With the aid of state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, this project aims at improving the decision making mechanism for surface polishing of 3D printed components. Borrowed from REFERENCE, the model polishing environment is designed as an MDP to minimize the power consumption while reaching the desired surface roughness. The state variable is continuous and defined by the average roughness parameter, Sa; the action variables are discrete and are defined by the applied force (F) and Relative rotational speed (v) between the workpiece and the polishing pad; the reward is defined by the power consumed by the polishing machine.
